# 🧠 MLCursor CLI — AI-Powered ML Developer in Your Terminal

MLCursor is a blazing-fast, privacy-first CLI tool that turns plain English into working machine learning code. It's like Cursor, but for your **terminal** — built specifically for training, tuning, and automating ML workflows with **one command**.

---

## 💡 What It Does

Understand prompts like:

> "Train an XGBoost classifier on the Titanic dataset with 50 epochs and max_depth 4"

✅ Auto-generates full training scripts using:

- PyTorch  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  
- LightGBM  
- CatBoost  
- TensorFlow (more to come)

✅ Installs all missing libraries so you don’t have to.

✅ Fully local — runs entirely on your system using models from Ollama (e.g., `qwen2.5-codeb3`).

✅ Keeps output scripts in a clean `outputs/` folder so you can inspect or reuse.

## ⚡ Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install typer jinja2 pandas scikit-learn

# 2. Pull a local model
ollama pull qwen2.5-codeb3

# 3. Run your first ML pipeline
mlcursor "Train a RandomForestClassifier on the penguins dataset for 20 epochs"
