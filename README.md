🧠 MLCursor CLI — AI-Powered ML Developer in Your Terminal
MLCursor is a blazing-fast, privacy-first CLI tool that turns plain English into working machine learning code. It’s like Cursor, but for your terminal — built specifically for training, tuning, and automating ML workflows with just one command.

🚀 What It Does
🧾 Understand prompts like:

"Train an XGBoost classifier on the Titanic dataset with 50 epochs and max_depth 4"

⚙️ Auto-generates full training scripts using:

PyTorch

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

LightGBM

CatBoost

TensorFlow
(More to come!)

📦 Auto-installs missing libraries so you don’t have to.

🧪 Fully local — runs entirely on your system using models from Ollama (e.g. qwen2.5-coder:3b).

🗂️ Keeps output scripts in a clean outputs/ folder so you can inspect or reuse.

🛠️ Quickstart
1. ⚙️ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install typer jinja2 pandas scikit-learn
Also install Ollama: https://ollama.com

2. 🧠 Pull a local model
bash
Copy
Edit
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:3b
3. 🐍 Run your first ML pipeline:
bash
Copy
Edit
python cli.py train "Train a RandomForestClassifier on the penguins dataset for 20 epochs"
That’s it. A training script will be:

Autogenerated ✍️

Auto-filled with dataset logic 📊

Auto-installed with dependencies 🔧

And run instantly ⚡

💡 Why MLCursor?
🧠 AI-native workflow — generate/train/tune in one line

🔐 Privacy-first — no cloud/OpenAI/Gemini needed

🖥️ Terminal-first — perfect for devs who live in CLI

🛠️ Framework-agnostic — supports every major ML framework

✨ Extendable — more modes coming soon: tune, eval, deploy

🛣️ Roadmap
🔁 Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna / Ray Tune

📦 Plugin system (e.g., mlcursor plugins)

☁️ Optional API keys for cloud models (Gemini, GPT-4)

🖼️ Image/Text dataset support

🧩 Modular support for any LLM backend

💻 VS Code Extension (future)

✨ Demo Prompt Ideas
bash
Copy
